# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project.

This project was done after completing the first 3 courses of the Backend Developer Learning Path, the three courses being Python, Linux and Git.

## What it does
BookBot analyses text files stored in the 'books' directory and generates a report containing word and character counts.

## Usage
1) Clone the repo.
2) Add whatever text/book you want analyzed into the 'books' directory.
3) Enter 'python3 main.py <path_to_text/book>' into your terminal.
