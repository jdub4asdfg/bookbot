# Bookbot

BookBot is my first Boot.dev project.

This project was done after completing the first 3 courses of the Backend Developer Learning Path, the three courses being Python, Linux and Git.

## What it does
BookBot analyses text files stored in the `books` directory and generates a report containing word and character counts.

## Usage
- Clone the repo using `git clone https://github.com/jdub4asdfg/bookbot.git`
- Create a `books` directory in the working directory using `mkdir books`
- Add whatever text file you want analysed into the `books` directory
- Enter `python3 main.py <path_to_text_file>` into your CLI while in the working directory.

Example: `python3 main.py books/frankenstein.txt`
