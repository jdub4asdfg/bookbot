# bookbot

BookBot is my first [Boot.dev](https://www.boot.dev) project.

This project was done after completing the first 3 courses of the Backend Developer Learning Path, the three courses being Python, Linux and Git.

## What it does
BookBot analyses text files stored in the 'books' directory and gives a report on its word and character count.

## How to use it
1) Add whatever text you want analyzed into the 'books' directory.
2) Enter 'python3 main.py <path_to_file>' into your terminal.
